# Overview
I developed a weather app hosted on a local server using Python, Django, the OpenWeatherMap API, and Bootstrap, which provided me with valuable experience in web development, API integration, and HTML.
 

# Goals
I had two primary objectives for this project:

1.	After a positive experience with Flask, I sought to deepen my understanding of web frameworks by building a project with Django. I aimed to improve my skills and knowledge of virtual environments, APIs, and web development concepts while exploring Django's potential.
2.	My next goal is based on discussions with experienced coders who emphasised the importance of learning about Git and publishing on GitHub. In my previous role, I used a collaborative working model to produce technical documentation and have used versioning extensively, particularly in SharePoint. Iâ€™m looking forward to start using Git version control and exploring how it works in a professional environment.
  

# Building the app
I explored Django through tutorials before choosing to build a weather app as my first Django project. While I used a tutorial video as a guide, I customized multiple aspects of the app to ensure I really grasped the logic behind building applications with Django.

These are the steps I took to complete this task:

1.	Created and activated the virtual environment.

2.	Installed the necessary dependencies.
3.	Created the main project and the app.
4.	Registered the app in settings.py.
5.	Defined the app's views.
6.	Configured the app's URLs.
7.	Created the app's templates.
8.	Rendered the templates.
9.	Obtained the OpenWeatherMap API key.
10.	Implemented the app's search functionality.

# Languages and Tools
* Python
* HTML
* Bootstrap

# Brief Notes
Building my Django weather app was a fascinating experience that allowed me to explore frameworks and integrate various technologies into a cohesive web application. Learning about API integration was particularly intriguing and opened new possibilities for future projects. The most valuable takeaway was gaining insight into website development while adhering to the DRY principle.

# Going Forward
* I plan to enhance features and usability while practicing version control with Git.
* I extensively researched object-oriented programming (OOP) and its benefits for maintainability, scalability, and readability in Django projects. Although I didn't fully implement OOP concepts in this project, I'm eager to explore them further in future endeavors.
